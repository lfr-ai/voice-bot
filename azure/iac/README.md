# Azure IaC for voice-bot

This folder contains Bicep modules and a top-level `main.bicep` to deploy the
minimal infrastructure required to run the backend service in Azure.

Included modules (Key Vault is optional and disabled by default):

- Log Analytics workspace
- Azure Container Registry
- App Service Plan
- Web App (Linux single-container)
- Storage Account
- Cognitive Services (placeholder for Azure OpenAI / Cognitive account)

## Usage (az cli)

```bash
az deployment group create --resource-group <rg> \
    --template-file azure/iac/main.bicep \
    --parameters containerImage=<acrLoginServer>/myimage:tag
```

Notes:

- This is a starting scaffold modeled after your golden-standard repos. Validate
  the Azure OpenAI/Cognitive resource requirements for your region and
  subscription before deploying.
- Secrets are not stored in Key Vault by default; provide them via environment
  variables or platform-managed secret stores. If you choose to enable Key
  Vault, add Role Assignments, Key Vault access policies and Managed Identity
  wiring as part of a separate workstream.
