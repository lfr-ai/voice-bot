# Contributing

Please read `README.md` and follow the coding conventions in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

Thank you for contributing! Please follow these guidelines.

- Use `uv` to manage dependencies (see `pyproject.toml`).

Run linters and tests before submitting PRs:

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run pre-commit hooks
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
uvx pytest -q
```

If you prefer PDM it is still supported; the repo contains the original
`pdm.lock`.

- Branch naming: `feature/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`
- Follow Conventional Commits; commitizen is configured in `pyproject.toml`.

Commit messages

This repository enforces Conventional Commits. Use Commitizen for interactive,
validated commit messages:

```bash
# create a commit using Commitizen
cz commit
# or quick alias
cz c
```

The repository includes a `.cz.toml` configuration and a pre-commit
`commit-msg` hook to validate commits.
