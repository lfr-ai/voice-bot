# Architecture

This repository follows Clean Architecture boundaries: presentation/
infrastructure -> application -> core.

`src/voice/core/` contains protocol interfaces and enums.

`src/voice/application/` contains business use-cases.

`src/voice/infrastructure/` contains adapters for LLMs, STT, DB, and other
external systems.

`src/voice/interaction/` contains the FastAPI presentation layer.

Key design decisions:

- LLM/chat interactions are implemented via a provider-agnostic LangChain
  adapter (`infrastructure/llm/chat_adapter.py`).
- Configuration uses Pydantic `AppSettings` (see
  `src/voice/config/settings.py`) following golden-standard practices.
- Secrets are provided via environment variables (`.env`) and are NOT stored in
  Azure Key Vault.

## Architecture analysis and migration plan

This document maps the existing project layout to a Clean Architecture
structure and lists recommended changes to align with the golden-standard
templates (`koda_automation` and `copier-fullstack-template`).

### Current layout (selected)

- `src/voice/config` — configuration
- `src/voice/interaction` — FastAPI entrypoint and static UI
- `src/voice/models` — mixed domain, infra, and 3rd-party client code
- `src/voice/managers` — orchestration helpers
- `src/voice/utils` — cross-cutting helpers

### Target layout (Clean Architecture)

- `src/voice/core/` — pure domain types, value objects, protocols, exceptions
- `src/voice/application/` — use cases, services, DTOs, orchestration logic
- `src/voice/infrastructure/` — concrete adapters (DB, external clients, STT,
  audio streamer)
- `src/voice/presentation/` — FastAPI routers, API models, HTTP dependencies
- `src/voice/composition/` — composition root (create_app, DI wiring)
- `src/voice/config/` — configuration and settings (Pydantic)
- `src/voice/prompts/` — LLM prompts
- `src/voice/utils/` — logging, helpers

### Short-term gaps to address (minimal, non-breaking)

1. Add a `composition.create_app()` factory and migrate `interaction/main.py`
   to call it. Maintain current top-level app for backwards compatibility
   during transition.
2. Add `core/` and `application/` folders (initially empty) and add
   guidelines for where new code should live.
3. Move any pure-domain models from `models/` into `core/` and create
   Protocols for external dependencies used by application services.
4. Add tests layout and a `Taskfile` for common commands.
5. Add CI, DevContainer, Dockerfile, pre-commit (already present), and
  `.env.example` (added).

### Migration plan (phases)

- Phase 1 (this PR): Documentation, composition root, CI, devcontainer,
  containerfile, env example, and gap analysis.
- Phase 2: Create `core`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and
  `presentation` folders; begin moving and refactoring modules with Protocol
  interfaces and unit tests.
- Phase 3: Add frontend scaffold (from `copier-fullstack-template`) into
  `frontend/` or connect to existing static files; add Playwright & Vitest if
  desired.
- Phase 4: Add comprehensive CI workflows (lint/test/build/release), Renovate,
  Dependabot, and release automation.

### Tooling migration

This repository is migrating from `pdm` to `uv` (Astral's uv) as the primary
dependency manager and task runner. A helper script
`scripts/migrate_to_uv.sh` was added to run `uv sync --all-extras` and
generate `uv.lock`. Commit `uv.lock` after review to complete the migration.

### Next steps (immediate)

1. Run `./scripts/migrate_to_uv.sh` in your development environment (or run
   `uv sync --all-extras`) and commit the generated `uv.lock` file.
2. Run `uvx pre-commit run --all-files` and `uv run pytest -q` to surface any
   linting or typing issues introduced by the toolchain change.
3. Execute `python scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py` and fix reported
   import boundary violations in separate, small PRs.

### Implemented governance and productivity scaffolding

- Root governance/tooling files added:
  - `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.dockerignore`, `.hadolint.yaml`
  - `.lychee.toml`, `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`, `.shellcheckrc`
  - `.typos.toml`, `.yamllint.yaml`, `bandit.toml`, `.secrets.baseline`
  - `cspell.json`, `renovate.json`
- CI normalized and consolidated under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- `.github` scaffolding added for:
  - copilot instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
  - scoped instructions (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`)
  - skills (`.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`)
  - hook governance (`.github/hooks/*`)
  - agent profiles (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`)
- Local architecture enforcement script added:
  - `scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py`
  - wired into `task architecture` and `task check`
- Dev environment scaffolding expanded:
  - `.devcontainer/compose.yml`, `Containerfile.dev`, lifecycle/support files
  - `docker/compose.yml` + `compose.dev/test/prod/override.yml`
  - updated VS Code settings, launch profile, and MCP config.

### Notes

- Keep runtime behavior unchanged during Phase 1. App factory will call the
  existing startup/shutdown logic.
- Ensure type hints and mypy pass during refactors.
